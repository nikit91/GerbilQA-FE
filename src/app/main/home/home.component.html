    <p>This is GERBIL. All your peanuts belong to me!</p>
    <p>
      We present GERBIL QA, an extension of the <a
      href="http://gerbil.aksw.org">general entity annotation system
      GERBIL</a>. It offers an easy-to-use web-based platform for the agile
      comparison of QA systems using multiple datasets and uniform
      measuring approaches.
      <!-- To add a tool to
              GERBIL, all the end user has to do is to provide a URL to a REST
              interface to its tool which abides by a given specification. The
              integration and benchmarking of the tool against user-specified
              datasets is then carried out automatically by the GERBIL platform.
              Currently, our platform provides results for 9 annotators and 11
              datasets with more coming. Internally, GERBIL is based on the
              Natural Language Programming Interchange Format (NIF) and provide
              Java classes for implementing APIs for datasets and annotators to
              NIF. -->
